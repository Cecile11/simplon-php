Documenting:
	Aknowledge about BaseObjects "magic stuff".
	Document the API format.
	Sort methods and attributes in a importance order, so that those that are more useful to the developer will stay at the top of the file.
	Document how templates work (classes, auto-generation).
	Document the Main class, what it does and how it does.
	Complete the inline documentation within the code.

Coding:
	Fix ElementsContainer's showView: it should show only the appropriate Element's data with "list" flag enabled.
	Add to Element Select and Multiple select actions.
	Add to Element "showAdmin" and "showPickable" and "showMultiPickable" methods (to be renamed).
	Add "edit" and "remove" actions to Element(s)Container's showView.
